+Basic Functions of all 4 Options are working
+Request API call will make an api call for the most recent flight at a specific airport

To-do:
>>Let user choose the airport to call from
>>Let user pick from the most recent flights? (need siginficantly more comms for this?)
>>Add departures function to mirror the arrivals api request function?



PASTED FROM PREVIOUS WORKSHOP FILE:
-maybe add more previous api calls to the dict by default

Make new api call
-look at opensky documentation, function to request by flight / departure loc?
-option to display aircraft IDs or recent departure locations for lv4?
-store in api dict afterwards

Censoring data:
-make new function that runs before each send statement 
(args: string to censor, current_user, clearance_dict)

Bonus:
-GUI?
-Ethernet?
-Save api call data to encrypted local file? 
(currently wiped each time the program ends)
